# TensorQTL workshop for the mQTL mapping using covariates

Before starting with the workshop, you should have [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/), python3, [TensorQTL and dependencies](https://github.com/broadinstitute/tensorqtl).

The inputs for TensorQTL in the case of performing cis-mQTLs with covariates are: 
- PLINK binary file (.bim, .bed, .fam) format for the genotype. 
- BED UCSC file for the phenotype 
- Text file for the covariates.
