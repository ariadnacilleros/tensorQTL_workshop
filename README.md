# TensorQTL workshop for the mQTL mapping using covariates

Before starting with the workshop, you should have [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/), python3, [TensorQTL and dependencies](https://github.com/broadinstitute/tensorqtl).

The inputs for TensorQTL in the case of performing cis-mQTLs with covariates are a PLINK binary file format for the genotype, a BED UCSC file for the phenotype and a text file for the covariates.
